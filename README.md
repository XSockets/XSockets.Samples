###UNZIP (important)
Once the zip is downloaded, make sure that the file has not been blocked by Windows. Right-click the file you downloaded and choose "Properties". If it says at the bottom of the properties window: "This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer" then make sure to click the "Unblock" button so that all of the binary files will be unzipped later on.

Now you can unzip the file to a location of your choosing
